![](.github/image.png)

Whiskers and Wings is a game project I made alongside 4 other students (Tom Bagnara, Alexandre Mans, LÃ©o Guillemart, Jacqueline Huynh) written in Python.

## Running

Make sure you have the latest version of Python installed alongside the Pygame module.
After that, use the following command
```python
python game.py
```
